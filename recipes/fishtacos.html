        <h1>Fish Tacos</h1>
        <p>Since you'll be having <em>fish</em> later, might as well get used to it now!</p>
        <p>Also, you simply can't go wrong with tacos.</p>
        <p>Here's what you'll need to make them:</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound cod, tilapia, halibut, or other white fish filets</li>
            <li>2 to 3 teaspoons chili powder, enough to coat the fish</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>3 to 4 tablespoons lime juice (from 2 limes)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce, optional</li>
            <li>1/2 small head red cabbage, shredded (about 4 cups)</li>
            <li>12 taco-sized corn or flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1 avocado, sliced</li>
            <li>4 radishes, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4 spring onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/3 cup roughly chopped cilantro</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Make the fish taco sauce:</h2>
                <p>In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, mayonnaise, lime juice, and hot sauce (if using) for the taco sauce. Stir until combined.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Make the red cabbage slaw:</h3>
                <p>In a medium bowl, combine the shredded cabbage with 3 tablespoons of the taco sauce. Stir to coat and add more taco sauce if you like. (The cabbage shouldn't be dripping with sauce; aim for a very thin coating.)</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Warm the tortillas:</h3>
                <p>n a dry skillet over medium-high heat, warm the tortillas one at a time for about 30 seconds on both sides. Alternatively, wrap 1 to 3 tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave for 30 seconds, until warm.</p>
                <p>Keep warmed tortillas wrapped in a clean dish towel while you make the fish.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Season the fish:</h3>
                <p>Sprinkle the fish on both sides with chili powder and salt. Gently rub in the seasonings with your fingers to make sure the fish is entirely coated.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook the fish:</h3>
                <p>Warm a large cast iron or nonstick skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat. When hot, add one tablespoon of olive oil and tilt the pan to entirely coat the bottom.</p>
                <p>Add the fish to the pan and cook for 2 minutes. Flip the fish and cook another 2 minutes. Flip and cook 1-2 minutes longer if needed; the fish is done when it is opaque all the way through and breaks apart easily. If any smaller, thinner pieces of the fish start to break off as you flip, just scoop them out and transfer them to a serving platter.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve the tacos:</h3>
                <p>Transfer the cooked fillets to a platter and use a fork or a knife to gently break the fish into large chunks. Assemble the tacos with a few pieces of fish, some cabbage slaw, toppings of your choice, and a drizzle of taco sauce.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
