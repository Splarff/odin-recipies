        <h2>Crepes</h2>
        <p>Crepes are yummy wummy. Here's what <strong>you</strong> need to make them:</p>
        <h2>Incredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour (1 cup)</li>
            <li>Eggs (2 large)</li>
            <li>Milk (1/2 cup)</li>
            <li>Water (1/2 cup)</li>
            <li>Salt (1/4 teaspoon)</li>
            <li>Butter (2 tablespoons; melted)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
